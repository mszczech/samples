# Veggie Seasons

The Veggie Seasons app has temporarily been moved to the
[experimental](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/master/experimental/veggieseasons)
directory of this repository due to the integration of state restoration into
the app. Not all features of state restoration are available on the stable
channel of flutter yet. Once commit
[flutter/flutter@053ebf2](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/053ebf2c080c7b8efbf4020683a5ba27d9daa3b8)
has reached the stable channel, the app can move back to its old home in
this directory.

For more info on how to run the samples in the `experimental` directory,
see the
[README](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/master/experimental/README.md)
in that folder.
